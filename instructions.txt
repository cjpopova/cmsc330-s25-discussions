cd ~/cmsc330spring25
dune init proj discussions # dune will create a new directory named discussions
code discussions # open VSCode

# all the following steps should be inside of the discussions folder. either `cd` into it, or use the VSCode terminal inside of the windows that just opened.

dune build # run this to setup the lib folder

# Optional: Add a .gitignore and commit initial setup. Copy the .gitignore file from your project 1 folder. `ls` usually hides files/folders that start with `.`, so run `ls -a` to see all files.

code lib/disc2.ml # add your code to this file
code test/dune # replace with the following. this tells the compiler to import the discussions module and setup a separate test file test_disc2
```
(tests
 (names test_discussions test_disc2)
 (libraries discussions oUnit))
```
code test/test_disc2.ml # add your tests to this file (copy structure from project1's tests/public/public.ml)
dune build
dune runtest
dune utop lib # open the repl. Then run `open Discussions.Disc2;;`
